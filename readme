2- open the source code in visual studio code
3- in VS code menu click on view tab and open the terminal 
then run the commands one be one-  
4- python -m venv venv 
5- venv\Scripts\activate
6- pip install -r requirements.txt

once all packages are isntalled then run below command to start the app-

Click on downward arrow button located in the same line towards right of the Post /Predict API, after clicking teh downward arrow it will show the api, now click on "try it out" button

and then pass the below smaple input json or testing, 

Here is the 2 sample input jsons -

1- For diabetics prediction == yes, use below

{
  "Pregnancies": 6,
  "Glucose": 148,
  "BloodPressure": 72,
  "SkinThickness": 35,
  "Insulin": 0,
  "BMI": 33.6,
  "DiabetesPedigreeFunction": 0.627,
  "Age": 50
}
 
 2- For diabetics prediction == no, use below

{
  "Pregnancies": 1,
  "Glucose": 85,
  "BloodPressure": 66,

  "Insulin": 0,
  "BMI": 26.6,
  "DiabetesPedigreeFunction": 0.351,
  "Age": 31
}

Note: 
main.py contains the logic for running the API with one person input data and trigger the trained model to get the result
however, train_model.py contains the logic for training data and then and repacking the model and save the updated trained model into model.pkl, scaler.pkl and imputer.pkl files

To run the train_model,py localy, please follow below steps [TBD]
